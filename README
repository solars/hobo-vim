= hobo.vim http://github.com/solars/hobo-vim/

Depends on rails.vim, http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1567

== Description

This vim plugin uses the scripts of drnic's hobo-tmbundle, instantiate_tags and autocomplete_tags

It enables you to:
  
  - autocomplete hobo tags (including your custom ones) based on a partial prefix
  - instantiate hobo tags (eg. fetch all available params inside a tag definition)

and sets highlighting/indentation (xml or eruby) for dryml files, which is quite limited at the moment.

== Suggested installation

The file structure should be clear, just copy it into your $HOME dir, resulting in:

~/bin/instantiate_tag.rb
~/bin/autocomplete_tag.rb
~/lib/drnic/{hobo-tmbundle-files}
~/.vim/plugin/hobo.vim

== Usage

  - Autocompletion: uses normal vim omni completion (ctrl-x ctrl-o)
  - Tag Instantiation: press F5 in insert mode, enter tagname

To remap the keybinding for Instatiation in ~/.vimrc use:

  - map <F6> <Plug>HoboInstantiate

== Notes

The files in lib/drnic/ are from hobo-tmbundle written by drnic, available at:
